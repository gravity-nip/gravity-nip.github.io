#### Our research philosophy

Chandra's lifelong _quest for perspectives_ is the core inspiration of our intellectual adventures. We summarize this with two quotes (emphases ours):

> After the early preparatory years, my scientific work has followed a certain pattern motivated, principally, by <b> a quest after perspectives</b>. In practise, this quest has consisted in my choosing (after some trials and tribulations) a certain area which appears amenable to cultivation and compatible with my taste, abilities, and temperament. And when after some years of study, I feel that I have accumulated a sufficient body of knowledge and achieved a view of my own, I have the urge to present <b> my point of view</b>, ab initio, in a coherent account with order, form, and structure. -- S. Chandrasekhar (1983 Nobel Prize Autobiography)

> The pursuit of science has often been compared to the scaling of mountains, high and not so high. But who amongst us can hope, even in imagination, to scale the Everest and reach its summit when the sky is blue and the air is still, and in the stillness of the air survey the entire Himalayan range in the dazzling white of the snow stretching to infinity? None of us can hope for a comparable vision of nature and of the universe around us. <b> But there is nothing mean or lowly in standing in the valley below and awaiting the sun to rise over Kinchinjunga</b>. -- S. Chandrasekhar (1990), Truth and Beauty: Aesthetic and the Motivations of Science.

Though our efforts are always driven by curiosity and fun, our ultimate goal is to build our own coherent pictures of this wonderful Universe.
