Membership to the Gravity Group is contingent on a selective and rigorous apprenticeship program designed to strengthen mathematical methods (dimensional analysis, dynamical systems, special functions, and differential geometry) and to teach soft research skills (writing, LaTeX) that are essential to scholarly work in physics. All Gravity members take at least one general relativity course as an elective; most take several GR electives. Students work on research projects that develop proficiency with Mathematica and/or Python. They routinely subject their research writing to rigorous peer review through the annual [SPP <i>Samahang Pisika ng Pilipinas</i> (Philippine Physics Society) conference proceedings](https://proceedings.spp-online.org/).

The group holds a weekly <b> Monday Journal Club</b> to keep us up-to-date on the latest research developments, which also helps strengthen our students' critical thinking and public speaking. To cultivate wide interest in physics, we meet for <b>Crazy Gravity Fridays</b>, which are informal meetings for critically discussing physics topics outside our areas of expertise, and are usually based on articles from <i> Physics Today </i> or <i> Quanta Magazine.</i> These are fun opportunities for us to explore unfamiliar topics. They help us become fluent with many ideas and remind us of the underlying disciplinary unity of physics. Finally, we organize a highly interactive <b>Annual Gravity Workshop</b> that runs for two weeks in the midyear/summer term, in which faculty and students take turns lecturing, calculating, and coding, on various planned topics in gravity and geometry. These activities help build solid foundations for our students to achieve success in a wide variety of careers.
