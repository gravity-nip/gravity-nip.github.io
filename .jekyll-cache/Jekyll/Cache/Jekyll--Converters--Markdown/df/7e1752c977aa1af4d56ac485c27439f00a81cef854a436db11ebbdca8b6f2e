<p><b> Theoretical physics. Astrophysics. Geometry.</b> <br /> These three research themes are bound together by our modern theory of gravity: Einstein’s general relativity.</p>

<p>Our group’s broad goal is to explore and better understand <b> gravity </b> in all its facets. We hope to gain insight and to develop fresh perspectives on its interesting features and its many peculiar effects, and to address gaps in our knowledge that continue to exist. Our goals demand that we continue to sharpen our conceptual, mathematical, and numerical tools. The interconnected topics below endure as objects of our excitement and fascination.</p>

<h4 id="black-holes-stars-and-spacetime-exotica">Black holes, stars, and spacetime exotica</h4>

<p>Dead things are rarely fascinating. But black holes, the corpses of dead stars, are where gravity becomes strongest in the Universe. And so we naturally gravitate to them. <i> (Pun intended.) </i> Our cosmic necromancy conjures questions like: How do objects move in extremely strong gravitational environments? How do we characterize physical processes occurring around them? What new physical effects are made possible by the extreme gravity? What is the structure of black holes in alternative theories of gravity? How can black holes help us decide between general relativity and its competitors? On the stellar progenitors of these black holes, we ask: What is their structure, particularly in alternative gravity theories? How do stars pulsate? How do they tidally disrupt when traveling in the vicinity of black holes? For fun, we also play with closely-related “exotic” spacetimes such as wormholes and warp-drives, and try to understand their physical properties. Though these exotica exist mostly in science fiction, we perform calculations aimed at understanding what strange physical phenomena they might give rise to, and in the process gain an appreciation of the physics of strongly curved spacetime.</p>

<h4 id="gravitational-waves">Gravitational waves</h4>

<p>The age of gravitational waves is here. An exciting new observational window to the cosmos has thus been opened, granting us access to the graceful dances of invisible cosmic giants and the faintest whimpers from the birth of our Universe. What a view it is! Our group is interested in the modeling of sources of these gravitational waves. In particular, we wish to understand how environmental factors affect the gravitational waves produced by, say, black holes orbiting each other. One enduring system of interest is the so-called extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) for future space-based gravitational wave antennas such as LISA. A key aspect to their modeling is the incorporation of radiation-reaction or self-force effects. Thus, we also perform computations and studies of the self-force in unexplored physical settings.</p>

<h4 id="alternative-theories-of-gravity">Alternative theories of gravity</h4>

<p>General relativity is our best gravity theory to date, and it continues to pass every empirical test thrown its way exceedingly well. However, Einstein’s gravity is known to become vulnerable on opposing extreme distance scales: the very small, where the obstinate quantum is king, and the very large, where general relativity collaborates with dark shady characters — dark matter and dark energy. As a result, a plethora of alternative theories now vie to provide a more complete description of gravitational phenomena at all scales. Our group explores the rich phenomenology afforded by these non-Einsteinian theories. We ask, for instance, what sort of physical predictions become possible when gravity carries more than just its metric degrees of freedom, such as perhaps an extra scalar or vector. We want to know if (or which of) the competitors survive the battery of empirical evidence brought in by new astrophysical observations. These investigations occasionally teach us lessons about general relativity itself, by allowing us to contrast the latter from its purportive usurpers.</p>

<h4 id="theoretical-cosmology">Theoretical cosmology</h4>

<p>What is perhaps most remarkable about relativistic gravity theories is their scope. They not only explain how we are able to keep our feet on the ground, they also provide a powerful framework for understanding the origins of everything that exists. Our group studies cosmological models supported by alternative theories of gravity. We have found it fruitful to adopt dynamical systems methods in these endeavors. We try to answer questions like: What is the long-term evolution of the Universe? Can the accelerated expansion of the Universe be accommodated within a gravity theory without need for dark energy? For an alternative theory of gravity, does this requirement leave sufficient room for it to match the successes of GR on Solar System scales?</p>

<h4 id="celestial-dynamics">Celestial dynamics</h4>

<p>Over Solar System scales, GR presents itself as a tiny correction at best. For this reason, Newtonian celestial mechanics remains a fascinating topic with many applications in modern space science, from optimal spacecraft trajectory determination to the dynamical origins of exoplanetary systems. A wealth of mathematical techniques can be mined from celestial mechanics that prove useful in relativistic settings. Our group studies hierarchical “small-N”-body problems in search of new physical effects such as the Kozai-Lidov effect. We have also investigated dynamical friction in unexplored contexts. Extending celestial mechanics to the relativistic regime opens up even more exciting prospects. For instance, a relativistic object’s spin couples to spacetime curvature and gives rise to richer dynamical behavior. Our group studies these interesting systems with numerical simulations and dynamical systems methods.</p>

<h4 id="applied-differential-geometry-and-nonlinear-dynamics">Applied differential geometry and nonlinear dynamics</h4>

<p>Differential geometry is the grammar of modern gravity. In learning this intricate calculus, we develop a strong affinity for physics problems where our geometric tools can be usefully applied. We continue to explore problems in domains that aren’t gravitational, but nevertheless share common geometric descriptions. For instance, geometric thermodynamics, gauge/geometric mechanics, information geometry in data analysis, manifold learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction — there are some of the areas in which we are actively engaged. As gravitational interactions are naturally non-linear, we borrow heavily from fields of chaos and nonlinear dynamics, and utilize their methods for studying gravitationally interacting systems. We have applied these techniques to gain useful insights on the structure of the phase spaces of spinning bodies and charged particles in curved spacetime.</p>

<h4 id="our-research-philosophy">Our research philosophy</h4>

<p>Chandra’s lifelong <em>quest for perspectives</em> is the core inspiration of our intellectual adventures. We summarize this with two quotes (emphases mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the early preparatory years, my scientific work has followed a certain pattern motivated, principally, by <b> a quest after perspectives </b>. In practise, this quest has consisted in my choosing (after some trials and tribulations) a certain area which appears amenable to cultivation and compatible with my taste, abilities, and temperament. And when after some years of study, I feel that I have accumulated a sufficient body of knowledge and achieved a view of my own, I have the urge to present <b> my point of view </b>, ab initio, in a coherent account with order, form, and structure. – S. Chandrasekhar (1983 Nobel Prize Autobiography)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pursuit of science has often been compared to the scaling of mountains, high and not so high. But who amongst us can hope, even in imagination, to scale the Everest and reach its summit when the sky is blue and the air is still, and in the stillness of the air survey the entire Himalayan range in the dazzling white of the snow stretching to infinity? None of us can hope for a comparable vision of nature and of the universe around us. <b> But there is nothing mean or lowly in standing in the valley below and awaiting the sun to rise over Kinchinjunga</b>. – S. Chandrasekhar (1990), Truth and Beauty: Aesthetic and the Motivations of Science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though our efforts are always driven by curiosity and fun, our ultimate goal is to build our own coherent pictures of this wonderful Universe.
